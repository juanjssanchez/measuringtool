This measuring tool can be used to outline a roof and generate a rough estimate of square footage, materials needed, etc. You can import a photo of any roof and start outlining as long as you know the measurement of at least 1 edge of the roof. You can also edit the edges in order to specify what type of edge it is (ridge, valley, etc). Make sure to click the existing points if you are outlining a slope that shares an edge with a shape you have already created.

## Setting the scale

The first line you create will prompt you to enter the real world measurement for that line. This reference line must be accurate in order for the rest of the measurements to be properly scaled.

In the drop down menu, click Edit Line Mode to start labeling the edges. At the bottom of the screen you can choose a label type and simply click on a line to label it.
